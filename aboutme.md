 My name is **Yongze Yu**. I am a **Ph.D. candidate** in Physical Chemistry at the [Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/) studying in the modeling of the spectroscopy data for electron transfer on material interface and constructing machine learning models for predicting the consequences of the chemical processes. I recieved my B.S. in Chemistry at Lanzhou Univeristy.
 But, Now, I am a fan of **Data Science** and **Artificial Intelligence**. 
    
- I love traveling
- I love classical music
- I love my family

What else do you need?

 _Want to hear my stroy? Want to know how and why I decide my career even without a Computer Science degree?_

## My history


To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
