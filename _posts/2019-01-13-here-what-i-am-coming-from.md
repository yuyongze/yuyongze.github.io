## Write before
Many of high-level student like me who is desired to make a shift from their original major like chemistry, biology, physics,etc. to computer science(CS), statitics, or other realted feilds. Have you ever heard an instance who transfer his/her major from CS to chemsitry? At least, I don't. You know why? Because, first, there are a big mismatch between the currenty PhD graduates and job opponitities in those feilds. I cite an example published in Nature News [here](http://icorsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Too-many-phds-Nature-2015.pdf) "In October,2015, Stanford University in California published the results of a major effort to track graduates either 5 or 10 years after their PhD. It showed that the number of bioscience PhD students progressing to postdoctoral positions had dropped from 41% to 31% in the more recent graduate group, and that many were moving into business, government or non-profit positions. "  Secondly, a [huge salary difference](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Degree=Doctorate_(PhD)/Salary) if they continue to reaserch job in orginal fields comparing to IT realted jobs. I hope to share my experience with you how I end up with jumping into the Data Science(in process) from non-computer sciene background. 


## Who am I now? 
I am currently a Ph.D. candition at Ohio State University studying in Physical Chemistry. My research fucus is about the spectroscipy modeling for understainding electron transfer preocess on electronics. And I recently finished a project using machine learning to build a classification model which is able to predict the outcomes of compatibility of [perosvksite materials](https://www.nrel.gov/news/features/2018/nrel-inks-a-future-for-perovskites.html) with specific treatment ([link](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsenergylett.8b02451)). 
I started to learn machine learning and artificient intenllence about April, 2018. Them, I became a fan of data science and progroming. 

## Who as I?
#### I had programming training when I was a child
I had a programming training in [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)) language when I was in primary school at the age of 10. With the command "FD 100, RT 90, FD 100, RT 100, RT 90, FD 100 ", you can draw a rectangle on screen by a "turtle". 
Then I start to learn C language when I was in middle school. I learn what is [Variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science)),[Pointer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)), [List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_(abstract_data_type)), and so on. I learned how to solved a lot interesting questions like [Eight queens puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle). That was a lot of fun.
