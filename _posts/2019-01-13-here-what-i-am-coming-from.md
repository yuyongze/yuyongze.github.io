subtitle: This is a new journey--A story of mine about how you can make a shift to data scientist from non-computer science major.

## Write before
Many of high-level student like me who is desired to make a shift from their original major like chemistry, biology, physics, etc. to computer science(CS), statistics, or other related fields. Have you ever heard an instance who transfers his/her major from CS to chemistry? At least, I don't. You know why? Because, first, there is a big mismatch between the current Ph.D. graduates and job opportunities in those fields. I cite an example published in Nature News [here](http://icorsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Too-many-phds-Nature-2015.pdf) "In October 2015, Stanford University in California published the results of a major effort to track graduates either 5 or 10 years after their Ph.D. It showed that the number of bioscience Ph.D. students progressing to postdoctoral positions had dropped from 41% to 31% in the more recent graduate group and that many were moving into business, government or non-profit positions. "  Secondly, a [huge salary difference](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Degree=Doctorate_(Ph.D.)/Salary) if they continue to research job in original fields comparing to IT related jobs. I hope to share my experience with you how I end up with jumping into the Data Science(in the process) from a non-computer science background. Hope is blog could help you if you decide to make a shift. 


## Who am I now? 
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate studying in Physical Chemistry. My research focus is about the spectroscopy modeling for understanding electron transfer process on electronics. And I recently finished a project using machine learning to build a classification model which is able to predict the outcomes of compatibility of [perosvksite materials](https://www.nrel.gov/news/features/2018/nrel-inks-a-future-for-perovskites.html) with specific treatment ([link](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsenergylett.8b02451)). 
I started to learn machine learning and artificial intelligence about April 2018. Them, I became a fan of data science and programming. 

## Who as I?
#### I had programming training when I was a child
I had a programming training in [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)) language when I was in primary school at the age of 10. With the command "FD 100, RT 90, FD 100, RT 100, RT 90, FD 100 ", you can draw a rectangle on screen by a "turtle". 
Then I start to learn the C language when I was in middle school. I learn what is [Variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science)), [Pointer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)), [List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_(abstract_data_type)), and so on. I learned how to solved a lot of interesting questions like [Eight queens puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle). That was a lot of fun. 

#### Training in other major for 10 years
I received my B.S in Chemistry as my undergraduate. I got involved some projects relating to the materials and energies. I started my Ph.D. in physical chemistry because I like mathematics, physics, and modeling. I don't get a systematic course training on programming in college and graduate student. But, actually, I got all grade A for any courses which involve coding, for example, Kinetics using [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) and Advance quantum mechanics (which need to use [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)). 
Even if, in my research lab, I did not get so many training about coding at the beginning, most of the time is about understanding a scientific concept and collecting data from the instruments, synthesis some "cool" compounds as a Chemist, a voice from my inner heart and public advertisement from media pushed me towards a new direction, where I am now.

## How make the move?
I heard a lot of voices about machine learning or artificial intelligence from outside my research field, mainly from the news-- [big data era](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dorieclark/2013/08/08/four-things-you-need-to-know-in-the-big-data-era/), [AlphGo] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo) beat human champions, [facial recognition](https://www.wired.com/story/future-of-facial-recognition-technology/) tech has been applied in new-generation iPhones. All that voices drove me to start to look at what is machine learning, what is AI? 

#### From zero to zero point one
I was beginning in googling "machine learning course". The first watched video is the online open courses from Caltech, giving by Professor Yaser S. Abu-Mostafa.([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbyG85GZ0PI)) The lectures introduce very fundamental concepts about machine learning and learning problems. A very strong foundation of mathematics, linear algebra, statistics are needed to entirely understand and follow the contents. I barely can hold on the majority of the concepts, but importantly these lectures bring me a broad frame to the word of machine learning. (Actually I realize that later on I don't recommend to learn these lectures  at the very very begin without too many CS background)

#### Welcome on the board
The really important event that affect me hugely for later studying decisions is the course I took on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).  The course ["Machine Learning"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) is taught by the professor from the Standford University [Andrew_Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng). He is the best teacher I have ever met. He explained how machine learning works from simple to complex, from fundamental to practical, which really bring me a lot of interests into these fields.  
Continue from that, I stuck on the Coursera and started my online learning journey. I learned Python language with no previous experience and applied machine learning from Michigan University. ([link1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis?specialization=data-science-python),[link2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-machine-learning?specialization=data-science-python)) I learned what is deep learning about from [deeplearning.ai](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). I also got some experience from cloud computing from [IBM](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ibm-data-science-professional-certificate) and [Google Cloud Plantform](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-tensorflow-gcp). 
*(I will post the my studying experimence and notes about these Cousera courses shrotly.)*

While I was learning the machine learning on Cousera,
