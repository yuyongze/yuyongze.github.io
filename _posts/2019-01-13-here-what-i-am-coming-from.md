## Write before
Many of high-level student like me who is desired to make a shift from their original major like chemistry, biology, physics,etc. to computer science(CS), statitics, or other realted feilds. Have you ever heard an instance who transfer his/her major from CS to chemsitry? At least, I don't. You know why? Because, first, there are a big mismatch between the currenty PhD graduates and job opponitities in those feilds. I cite an example published in Nature News [here](http://icorsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Too-many-phds-Nature-2015.pdf) "In October,2015, Stanford University in California published the results of a major effort to track graduates either 5 or 10 years after their PhD. It showed that the number of bioscience PhD students progressing to postdoctoral positions had dropped from 41% to 31% in the more recent graduate group, and that many were moving into business, government or non-profit positions. "  Second, 


## Who am I now? 
I am currently a Ph.D. candition at Ohio State University studying in Physical Chemistry. My research fucus is about the spectroscipy modeling for understainding electron transfer preocess on electronics. And I recently finished a project using machine learning to build a classification model which is able to predict the outcomes of compatibility of [perosvksite materials](https://www.nrel.gov/news/features/2018/nrel-inks-a-future-for-perovskites.html) with specific treatment ([link](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsenergylett.8b02451)). 
I started to learn machine learning and artificient intenllence about April, 2018. Them, I became a fan of data science and progroming. 

## How can I achieve this?
