## Write before
Many of high-level student like me who is desired to make a shift from their original major like chemistry, biology, physics, etc. to computer science(CS), statistics, or other related fields. Have you ever heard an instance who transfers his/her major from CS to chemistry? At least, I don't. You know why? Because, first, there is a big mismatch between the current Ph.D. graduates and job opportunities in those fields. I cite an example published in Nature News [here](http://icorsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Too-many-phds-Nature-2015.pdf) "In October 2015, Stanford University in California published the results of a major effort to track graduates either 5 or 10 years after their Ph.D. It showed that the number of bioscience Ph.D. students progressing to postdoctoral positions had dropped from 41% to 31% in the more recent graduate group and that many were moving into business, government or non-profit positions. "  Secondly, a [huge salary difference](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Degree=Doctorate_(Ph.D.)/Salary) if they continue to research job in original fields comparing to IT related jobs. I hope to share my experience with you how I end up with jumping into the Data Science(in the process) from a non-computer science background. Hope is blog could help you if you decide to make a shift. 


## Who am I now? 
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate studying in Physical Chemistry. My research focus is about the spectroscopy modeling for understanding electron transfer process on electronics. And I recently finished a project using machine learning to build a classification model which is able to predict the outcomes of compatibility of [perosvksite materials](https://www.nrel.gov/news/features/2018/nrel-inks-a-future-for-perovskites.html) with specific treatment ([link](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsenergylett.8b02451)). 
I started to learn machine learning and artificial intelligence about April 2018. Them, I became a fan of data science and programming. 

## Who as I?
#### I had programming training when I was a child
I had a programming training in [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)) language when I was in primary school at the age of 10. With the command "FD 100, RT 90, FD 100, RT 100, RT 90, FD 100 ", you can draw a rectangle on screen by a "turtle". 
Then I start to learn the C language when I was in middle school. I learn what is [Variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science)),[Pointer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)), [List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_(abstract_data_type)), and so on. I learned how to solved a lot of interesting questions like [Eight queens puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle). That was a lot of fun. 

#### Training in other major for 10 years
I received my B.S in Chemistry as my undergraduate. I got involved some projects relating to the materials and energies. I started my Ph.D. in physical chemistry because I like mathematics, physics, and modeling. I don't get a systematic course training on programming in college and graduate student. But, actually, I got all grade A for any courses which involve coding, for example, Kinetics using [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) and Advance quantum mechanics (which need to use [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)). 
Even if, in my research lab, I did not get so many training about coding at the beginning, most of the time is about understanding a scientific concept and collecting data from the instruments, synthesis some "cool" compounds as a Chemist, a voice from my inner heart and public advertisement from media pushed me towards a new direction, where I am now.
