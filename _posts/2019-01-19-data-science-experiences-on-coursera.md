**Data science** is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured, similar to data mining.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science#cite_note-:0-1)

More and more people are intested to learn Data Science. No matter you are undergraduates, graduates or have worked for a long time, it is never too late to learn Data Science.  

_So how can we start?_  
There are many data science online websites like [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org), [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), etc. It is easy to get start without the  too many requirements of previous expriences.   
Up to now, I have finished 30 individual Courseara courses with 4 specializations.And I am taking the 31 and finishig the 5th specialzaitons. Therefore, I will briefly introduce you what is Coursera and how these courses/specializations look like. 

### What is Coursera?

**Coursera** (/kərˈsɛrə/) is an online learning platform founded by Stanford professors Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller that offers courses, specializations, and degrees.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coursera) You can auditory some of the course free, but if you want to get the certificate you have to pay for it and finish the assingment. And a lot of courses are packed into a specilization, you don't have to pay for each course you just need to pay $49 per month to learn the courses in the specilization. 

_Now, I will list the courses/specilization I have token. Then I will give very short description and and my rating the comment for those courses._

### Courses/Specilization List
- [**Machine Learning**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by *Standfrod Univeristy*   
Recomendation: 5/5  
Notes: Suitable for beginner
Comments: This is the _best_ course I had ever token. It is suitable for every machine learner. You will learn what is machine learning, how to create a machine learning program from scracth in this course. Unlike other machine learning class, this course contains a lot of **fundamentals of machine learning algorithms**.  If you can understand every section of content, you will be able to see how ML works under the hood.   
There are *Matlab* programming assignments. (Why matlab? not Python? Because you need to the code basic math to understand how these algorithms work. ) There are good instructions for each assignments. So you can finish them without too much trouble. (I learned a lot from the assignments)  
Main contents: Supervised/Unsupervided Learning, Cost function, Gradient descent, Regression and Classification, Regularization, Bias vs. Variance, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines,Clustering, etc.   
- [Applied Data Science with Python Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python) by _Michigan University_  
Recomenation: 4/5  
Notes: Suitable for beginner
Comments: I just finished two courses [Introduction to Data Science in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis?specialization=data-science-python) and [Applied Machine Learning in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-machine-learning?specialization=data-science-python) in this speciation. At the time of learning these two classes, I have almost zero experiemence in Python. From the first course "Introduction to Data Science in Python", I start to get used to the gramma of python code. And understand what is pandas? what is numpy? How to manupilate a DataFrame. The assigments are _very very hard_ for non-experimenced learners. There are no much instruction how to finish the questions in the assignments. You have to look [Pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html), ask [StackoverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and  _try out yourself_.
