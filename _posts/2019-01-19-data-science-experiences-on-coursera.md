**Data science** is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured, similar to data mining.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science#cite_note-:0-1)

More and more people are intested to learn Data Science. No matter you are undergraduates, graduates or have worked for a long time, it is never too late to learn Data Science.  

_So how can we start?_  
There are many data science online websites like [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org), [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), etc. It is easy to get start without the  too many requirements of previous expriences.   
Up to now, I have finished 30 individual Courseara courses with 4 specializations.And I am taking the 31 and finishig the 5th specialzaitons. Therefore, I will briefly introduce you what is Coursera and how these courses/specializations look like. 

### What is Coursera?

**Coursera** (/kərˈsɛrə/) is an online learning platform founded by Stanford professors Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller that offers courses, specializations, and degrees.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coursera) You can auditory some of the course free, but if you want to get the certificate you have to pay for it and finish the assignment. And a lot of courses are packed into a specialization, you don't have to pay for each course you just need to pay $49 per month to learn the courses in the specialization. 

_Now, I will list the courses/specialization I have taken. Then I will give a very short description and my rating the comment for those courses._

### Courses/Specialization List
- [**Machine Learning**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by *Standford University*   
**Recommendation:** 5 / 5  
**Notes:** Suitable for ML beginner, recommend for everyone  
**Comments:** This is the _best_ course I had ever taken. It is suitable for every "machine learner". You will learn what is machine learning, how to create a machine learning program from scratch in this course. Unlike other machine learning class, this course contains a lot of **fundamentals of machine learning algorithms**.  If you can understand every section of content, you will be able to see how ML works under the hood.   
There are *Matlab* programming assignments. (Why Matlab? not Python? Because you need to the code basic math to understand how these algorithms work.) There are good instructions for each assignment. So you can finish them without too much trouble. (I learned a lot from the assignments)  
_**Main contents**: Supervised/Unsupervised Learning, Cost function, Gradient descent, Regression and Classification, Regularization, Bias vs. Variance, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Clustering, etc._   

- [Applied Data Science with Python Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python) by _Michigan University_  
**Recommendation:** 4 / 5  
**Notes:** Suitable for beginner, useful for new Python learner and new ML learner  
**Comments:** I just finished two courses [Introduction to Data Science in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis?specialization=data-science-python) and [Applied Machine Learning in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-machine-learning?specialization=data-science-python) in this speciation. At the time of learning these two classes, I have almost zero experience in Python. From the first course "Introduction to Data Science in Python", I start to get used to the grammar of python code. And understand what is pandas? what is numpy? How to manipulate a DataFrame. The assignments are _very very hard_ for non-experienced learners( because many contents are not mentioned in the lecture). There is no much instruction about how to finish the questions in the assignments. You have to look [Pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html), ask [StackoverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and  _try out yourself_. I still remember I spent about 8 hours continuously for a single one of the assignments. But I think it is worth.  
_**Main contents**: Python coding, DataFrme, Numpy_   
The 2nd course, I learned, is "Applied Machine Learning in Python". Basically, in this course, you will learn how to use [**SciKit Learn**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) package to build a simple easy ML model for data mining and data analysis. You can easily build an ML model by several lines of code and test if your model is good or not. Similar to the first course above, the assignment is very hard, you have to read and look up the scikit learn documentation to finish all assignments.  Overall, I get a lot of hands-on experiences from the courses.  
_**Main contents**: SciKit Learn, K-Nearest Neighbors, Linear regression, Logistic regression, Decision Tree, Evaluation metrics_   

- [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) by _deeplearning.ai_    
**Recommendation:** 5 / 5  
**Notes:**  Better learn after "Machine Learning", worth to learn repeatedly. Recommend for each "Deep learner"   
**Comments:** This specialization includes 5 courses. They are taught by Prof.Andrew Ng as well. You will learn state-of-art deep learning algorithms in the field of artificial intelligence. These courses include a lot of math and fundamental insights of deep learning as well as the high-level buildup of how to implement codes to build deep-learning models. You will learn the fundamentals of how neural networks work and how to train the model step by step. Then you will know how to manage an ML project and build an ML project pipeline. Then, you will be introduced Convolutional Neural Networks([CNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network)) for computer vision tasks and Recurrent Neural Networks([RNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network)) for sequential tasks. The lectures covered how CNN and RNN built mathematically. It may be hard to digest if your first time learn Deep Learning. But, it is fine, you can go back and understand better when you have more and more practical experiences.  
_**Main contents**: ANN, CNN, RNN_  

- [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/what-is-datascience/) by _IBM_    
**Recommendations:** 4.5 / 5  
**Notes:** Suitable for beginner, but better to learn with some of the knowledge; more practical other than fundamentals
**Comments:** This specialization include 9 courses including a _capstone project_. I want to cite the description from the website here "Kickstart your Career in Data Science & ML. Master data science, learn Python & SQL, analyze & visualize data, build machine learning models." You will manage a Data Science project from end to end. This is more like a conceptual class, so it can help you build data science knowledge in a good shape. The content for each course is easy to follow. This also the first time I get to know about _Cloud_. You can run a notebook and use the storage on IBM storage.  Because I have learned the courses above, so I can finish most of the courses very quick.  
One characteristic of the specialization is the _capstone project_. You have to propose a project from what you learn, and finish the project using the tool that learns from the class. There are a lof new thing I learned from these classes, for example, SQL and database, Web Scraping using Python and [BeautifulSoup](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-web-scrape-with-python-in-4-minutes-bc49186a8460), use of [Foursquare](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs) API, interactive map with [folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/).   
_**Main contents**: SQL,Web Scraping, API,interactive map_  

- [(Advanced) Machine Learning with TensorFlow on Google Cloud Platform](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/advanced-machine-learning-tensorflow-gcp) by _Google Cloud_  
**Recommendations:** 4 / 5  
**Notes:** Not for a beginner, it is good for people to want to use GCP for ML project in the product. Need some sensor flow experience.  More about Data Engineer.  
**Comments:** There are two specilaziation starts with [Machine Learning with TensorFlow on Google Cloud Platform Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-tensorflow-gcp) and 10 courses in total.  The course would focus on how you can use Tensorflow on the Google Could Platform. (It is not about how to write Tensorflow code) Instead of teaching the knowledge, it is more about the introduction of their product on GCP. But I think it would be very helpful if the people are planning to start their ML project on GCP. For me, it feels a little bit overwhelmed at the beginning and barely catches up at the end of specialization. The second specialization of "Advance" title, it would teach you how to build production-ready ML project on GCP. It introduced some examples of a DNN predictive model, computer vision, natural language processing, and recommendation engine. It would be better if you have a current project working on the GCP.  
The class source is open source on GitHub repository at [here](https://github.com/yuyongze/training-data-analyst/tree/master/courses/machine_learning/deepdive).  
_**Main contents**: Google Cloud Platform_  

These are the courses I took time to time. I don't think it would the best choice to learning, but I hope these experiences could help you to choose the courses that best for you and fit your learning schedule.  If you have any questions, please contact me with no hesitation. Enjoy the Data Science!!
