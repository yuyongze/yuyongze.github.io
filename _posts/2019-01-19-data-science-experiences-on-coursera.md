**Data science** is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured, similar to data mining.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science#cite_note-:0-1)

More and more people are intested to learn Data Science. No matter you are undergraduates, graduates or have worked for a long time, it is never too late to learn Data Science.  

_So how can we start?_  
There are many data science online websites like [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org), [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), etc. It is easy to get start without the  too many requirements of previous expriences.   
Up to now, I have finished 30 individual Courseara courses with 4 specializations.And I am taking the 31 and finishig the 5th specialzaitons. Therefore, I will briefly introduce you what is Coursera and how these courses/specializations look like. 

### What is Coursera?

**Coursera** (/kərˈsɛrə/) is an online learning platform founded by Stanford professors Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller that offers courses, specializations, and degrees.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coursera) You can auditory some of the course free, but if you want to get the certificate you have to pay for it and finish the assignment. And a lot of courses are packed into a specialization, you don't have to pay for each course you just need to pay $49 per month to learn the courses in the specialization. 

_Now, I will list the courses/specialization I have taken. Then I will give a very short description and my rating the comment for those courses._

### Courses/Specialization List
- [**Machine Learning**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by *Standford University*   
Recommendation: 5 / 5  
Notes: Suitable for ML beginner, recommend for everyone
Comments: This is the _best_ course I had ever taken. It is suitable for every "machine learner". You will learn what is machine learning, how to create a machine learning program from scratch in this course. Unlike other machine learning class, this course contains a lot of **fundamentals of machine learning algorithms**.  If you can understand every section of content, you will be able to see how ML works under the hood.   
There are *Matlab* programming assignments. (Why Matlab? not Python? Because you need to the code basic math to understand how these algorithms work.) There are good instructions for each assignment. So you can finish them without too much trouble. (I learned a lot from the assignments)  
_**Main contents**: Supervised/Unsupervised Learning, Cost function, Gradient descent, Regression and Classification, Regularization, Bias vs. Variance, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Clustering, etc._   

- [Applied Data Science with Python Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python) by _Michigan University_  
Recommendation: 4 / 5  
Notes: Suitable for beginner, useful for new Python learner and new ML learner  
Comments: I just finished two courses [Introduction to Data Science in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis?specialization=data-science-python) and [Applied Machine Learning in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-machine-learning?specialization=data-science-python) in this speciation. At the time of learning these two classes, I have almost zero experience in Python. From the first course "Introduction to Data Science in Python", I start to get used to the grammar of python code. And understand what is pandas? what is numpy? How to manipulate a DataFrame. The assignments are _very very hard_ for non-experienced learners( because many contents are not mentioned in the lecture). There is no much instruction about how to finish the questions in the assignments. You have to look [Pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html), ask [StackoverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and  _try out yourself_. I still remember I spent about 8 hours continuously for a single one of the assignments. But I think it is worth.  
_**Main contents**: Python coding, DataFrme, Numpy_   
The 2nd course, I learned, is "Applied Machine Learning in Python". Basically, in this course, you will learn how to use [**SciKit Learn**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) package to build a simple easy ML model for data mining and data analysis. You can easily build an ML model by several lines of code and test if your model is good or not. Similar to the first course above, the assignment is very hard, you have to read and look up the scikit learn documentation to finish all assignments.  Overall, I get a lot of hands-on experiences from the courses.  
_**Main contents**: SciKit Learn, K-Nearest Neighbors, Linear regression, Logistic regression, Decision Tree, Evaluation metrics_   

- [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) by _deeplearning.ai_    
Recommendation: 5 / 5  
Notes:  Better learn after "Machine Learning", worth to learn repeatedly. Recommend for each "Deep learner"   
Comments: This specialization includes 5 courses. They are taught by Prof.Andrew Ng as well. You will learn state-of-art deep learning algorithms in the field of artificial intelligence. These courses include a lot of math and fundamental insights of deep learning as well as the high-level buildup of how to implement codes to build deep-learning models. You will learn the fundamentals of how neural networks work and how to train the model step by step. Then you will know how to manage an ML project and build an ML project pipeline. Then, you will be introduced Convolutional Neural Networks([CNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network)) for computer vision tasks and Recurrent Neural Networks([RNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network)) for sequential tasks. The lectures covered how CNN and RNN built mathematically. It may be hard to digest if your first time learn Deep Learning. But, it is fine, you can go back and understand better when you have more and more practical experiences.
