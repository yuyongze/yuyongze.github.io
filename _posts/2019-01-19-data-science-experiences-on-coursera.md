**Data science** is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured, similar to data mining.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science#cite_note-:0-1)

More and more people are intested to learn Data Science. No matter you are undergraduates, graduates or have worked for a long time, it is never too late to learn Data Science.  

_So how can we start?_  
There are many data science online websites like [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org), [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), etc. It is easy to get start without the  too many requirements of previous expriences.   
Up to now, I have finished 30 individual Courseara courses with 4 specializations.And I am taking the 31 and finishig the 5th specialzaitons. Therefore, I will briefly introduce you what is Coursera and how these courses/specializations look like.

**Coursera** (/kərˈsɛrə/) is an online learning platform founded by Stanford professors Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller that offers courses, specializations, and degrees.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coursera) You can auditory some of the course free, but if you want to get the certificate you have to pay for it and finish the assingment. And a lot of courses are packed into a specilization, you don't have to pay for each course you just need to pay $49 per month to learn the courses in the specilization. 

_Now, I will list the courses/specilization I have token. Then I will give very short description and and my rating the comment for those courses._
